# Live Math Equation Handwriting OCR

## Overview

This little project is based on the proposal of MSc Martijn Folmer, [a link](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/martijn-folmer-68026287_machinelearning-computervision-augmentedreality-activity-6787267790966468608-6NiA), using Dr. Adrian Rosebrock's tutorial
(OCR with Keras, TensorFlow, and Deep Learning - Part 1 and 2), which can be found in: [a link](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2020/08/17/ocr-with-keras-tensorflow-and-deep-learning/)

It is worth pointing out that I forgot of using a math symbols to train the ResNet, so it only understands multiplications of a variable and a coefficient,
for instance: 7x, or 8c, or 9.
